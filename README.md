searchFunction
==============

I had the General Info in mind when I made this. This is a search function that eventually will open the champion page if the user types the name of the champion in correctly, i.e. typing in "Vayne" will open Vayne's page. 

If the user incorrectly enters a name in the field, it will open a list of buttons that have possible entries based on the first letter the user entered.

For example, user types in "Vanye", Vanye is not a valid string, so the app will open a new screen with buttons that act as links to valid champions that start with the first letter. 

"Vanye" will open the screen and it will show Varus, Vayne, Veigar, Vel'Koz, Vi, Viktor, Vladimir, and Volibear. 

Obviously it won't show those names now, I just have placeholder string values based around the input "a". 

Successful entries will appear to do nothing, as the method call for these is currently empty, but it is very apparent what method needs to be changed to get it working. 

My main goal was to get the code for the dynamically created buttons up and running so others could use it. 

Let me know if you need help with any of the code.
